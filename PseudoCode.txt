How do you write pseudo code?
How do you write in C++ anyways? ._.

int main() {
	int timeForShift;
	Bunny bunny = new Bunny;	//BUNNY!
	Stage stage = new Stage;	//STAGE!
	Links links = new links;	//Links to different people's sites
	int gameIsInPlay = 1;		//I'm not sure if this is correct :/
	int winning = 1;
	
	while (gameIsInPlay) {		//loops the game foreverrrr
		if (winning) {			//starting game
			prepareGame();		//prepare game
			playGame();			//play it
		}
		if (timeForShift == 0) {
			winning = gameOver();			//game over :C
		}
	}
	return 0;
}

void prepareGame() {
	stage.randomize();			//random stage! maybe with stage = rand() % 5
	bunny.randomize();			//random position in scene
	timeForShift = (rand() % 10) * stage.number()	//random mod 10 * stage number = time before shift
	links.randomize();			//put links in different places
}

void playGame() {
	while (timeForShift > 0) {
		stage.fade(timeForShift);			//fade the stage according to the time
		//how to know if things have been pressed or swiped? I don't know :S
		//yay pseudo code ;-;
		if (stage.swiped)
			//change scene
		if (bunny.pressed)
			//Stuff happens... switch scene?
		if (links.pressed)
			//open browser to the link
		timeForShift--;
	}
}

int gameOver() {
	int deciding = 1;				//loop it at the game over screen
	while (deciding) {
		if (playAgain.pressed) {	//pressed play again!
			deciding = 0;
			return 1;
		}
		if (quit.pressed) {			//pressed Quit :C
