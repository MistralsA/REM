REM

Finally got to program something!
Though it only works on macs... and I have a PC :C
So far it does~
- Switch Stage number
- Some sort of transparency that corresponds with the time remaining before switching
- Some kind of image placing when time changes.
- Bunny moves!
- Room moves!
- Need more rooms!

Yay~?
